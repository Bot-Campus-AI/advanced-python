## Understanding Aggregation and Grouping

**What is Aggregation?**
Aggregation involves summarizing data by applying functions like sum, mean, count, etc. It's useful for deriving insights from large datasets.

**What is Grouping?**
Grouping involves splitting the data into groups based on some criteria and then applying aggregation functions to each group. This is particularly useful for comparing different subsets of the data.

## Aggregating Data

**Basic Aggregation Functions:**
Pandas provides several built-in functions for aggregation, such as `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, and `count`.

**Code Example: Basic Aggregation Functions**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'Name': ['Raj', 'Amit', 'Priya', 'Amit', 'Raj', 'Priya'],
    'Age': [30, 25, 35, 28, 32, 38],
    'Salary': [70000, 80000, 75000, 85000, 72000, 77000]
}
data_frame = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("DataFrame:\n", data_frame)

# Applying aggregation functions
total_salary = data_frame['Salary'].sum()
average_age = data_frame['Age'].mean()
max_salary = data_frame['Salary'].max()

print("\nTotal Salary:", total_salary)
print("Average Age:", average_age)
print("Maximum Salary:", max_salary)
```

## Grouping Data

**Grouping Data with `groupby`:**
The `groupby` method in Pandas is used to split the data into groups based on one or more columns.

**Code Example: Grouping Data**
```python
# Grouping data by Name
grouped_data = data_frame.groupby('Name')

# Aggregating data within each group
mean_salary = grouped_data['Salary'].mean()
total_salary = grouped_data['Salary'].sum()

print("\nMean Salary by Name:\n", mean_salary)
print("\nTotal Salary by Name:\n", total_salary)
```

## Applying Multiple Aggregation Functions

**Multiple Aggregations:**
You can apply multiple aggregation functions to a group using the `agg` method.

**Code Example: Applying Multiple Aggregations**
```python
# Applying multiple aggregation functions
agg_data = grouped_data['Salary'].agg(['mean', 'sum', 'max'])
print("\nMultiple Aggregations on Salary:\n", agg_data)
```

## Grouping by Multiple Columns

**Grouping by Multiple Columns:**
You can group data by multiple columns to create more detailed summaries.

**Code Example: Grouping by Multiple Columns**
```python
# Grouping data by Name and Age
multi_grouped_data = data_frame.groupby(['Name', 'Age'])

# Aggregating data within each group
multi_agg_data = multi_grouped_data['Salary'].sum()
print("\nTotal Salary by Name and Age:\n", multi_agg_data)
```

## Using `transform` for Group-Wise Operations

**Using `transform`:**
The `transform` method allows you to perform group-wise operations and return a DataFrame with the same shape as the original.

**Code Example: Using `transform`**
```python
# Adding a column for mean salary by group
data_frame['Mean Salary by Name'] = data_frame.groupby('Name')['Salary'].transform('mean')
print("\nDataFrame with Mean Salary by Name:\n", data_frame)
```
